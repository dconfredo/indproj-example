         <h2>Background</h2>
         <p>Kodi is an application installed on certain devices such as the Amazon Fire Stick, that allows you to instantly stream any Movie, TV show, Live TV channel, and music for free. Kodi allows the user to watch any movie from the beginning of movie production, to movies that are currently in thearter. As for TV Shows, no more paying for Netflix, Hulu, HBO Go, Showtime, or any other application that require daily payments. Kodi allows you to stream any show you would like no matter where it is aired. Another great thing about Kodi is that you no longer need to pay for a cable box because Kodi allows you to stream any TV channel from anywhere in the world. This includes all sporting events such as NFL Network, RedZone, NBA League Pass, or even Pay Per View event. They are all available for free through Kodi.  </p>
         <p>All the movies, TV shows, live TV, and music are all streamed through add-ons. Each add-on streams their own quality of what the user is searching for. If one add-on does not have what the user is looking for, another add-on will.</p>
